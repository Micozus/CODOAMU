## CODOAMU - find recipes for what you have in your fridge :)
######  Weekly task in [https://coderscamp.edu.pl/](https://coderscamp.edu.pl/) course

### **LIVE DEMO:** [click here](https://micozus.github.io/CODOAMU/)

App was designed to get a list of ingredients in user possesion and present a valid recipe list so he/she can make a dish from what he/she has :) App uses free api: (https://spoonacular.com/food-api), and some customly edited stock graphics from (https://www.freepik.com/).

Made in collaboration with [SixtyTo](https://github.com/sixtyto/), [ewefie](https://github.com/ewefie/) and [lfiedoro](https://github.com/lfiedoro)  as a part of weekly assignment in CodersCamp JS course. 

Focus of this task was to further practice group coding with tasks divided for each individual participant. App was created to practice: 
1) **webpack module building**, 
2) **api consuming and presenting data**, 
3) **using native apis like SpeechRecognition API**, 
4) **getting to know MVC project structure** 

Task division:
1) [SixtyTo](https://github.com/sixtyto/) - First webpack configuration, UI skeleton and some Material UI additions,
2) [ewefie](https://github.com/ewefie/) - SpeechRecognition API code, that can be used by Google Chrome users to provide ingredient names via built in microphone,
3) [lfiedoro](https://github.com/lfiedoro) - Api consuming module,
4) [Micozus](https://github.com/Micozus) - Merging modules into views, views navigation, UI polish, graphic redesign

**Tech used:**
1) JavaScript (ES6),
2) Webpack / Babel,
3) Sass
4) SpeechRecognition API (avaiable for Chrome users),
5) Material UI Lite

**TODO, after deployment for us would be to:**
1) Adding more debugging information / proper error messages for user,
2) Implementing mixed input mechanism,
3) Some code refactor to avoid code duplication.
